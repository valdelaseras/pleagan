    <h1>What is pleagan?</h1>
    <p>Pleagan is essentially a platform for two groups:</p>

    <ul class="reg-list">
      <li>
        for people on plant-based diets to initiate and support pleas to companies. The goal is a veganised version of
        an already existing product.
      </li>
      <li>
        for companies to get insight in the vegan market. If handled well, pleagan can be a place for exposure and
        promotion of your animal free product
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A virtuous circle</h2>

    <p>
      Of course many petitions and initiatives already exist scattered over the internet. Pleagan aims to aggregate this
      into one place, to help companies efficiently adjust their business strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
      At pleagan we believe the most effective way to a more vegan world is to increase demand. Consequently, the more
      plant-based products are available on the market, the easier it will be for people to consume more animal free
      products.

        <span class="bold">Quick tip:</span> you can initiate a plea yourself to gauge demand for your product.
      </p>

      <h3>Stats</h3>

      <p>
        With every plea we gather some stats and put them in handy graphs. These stats are intended to give you insight
        in the demand for the product, where demand might be the highest and how the plea for your product is doing
        compared to your competitors.
      </p>

      <p>
        These statistics are freely available for everybody to see. If you search your company or product name
        <a [routerLinkActive]="'active'" [routerLink]="['/plea', 'all']" class="underlined">here</a> and a plea comes
        up, open the plea and you will find the stats, along with a list of all supporters of the plea. You can also check out our
        <a [routerLinkActive]="'active'" [routerLink]="['/leaderboard']" class="underlined">leaderboards</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="larger">
        If a plea to your company has been initiated and a certain threshold of support has been reached, we will reach
        out to you.
      </p>
