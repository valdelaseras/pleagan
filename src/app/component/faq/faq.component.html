          <clr-accordion-title>What happens to my data?</clr-accordion-title>
          <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded>
            <h3>Email</h3>
            <p>
              When you support or initiate a plea, you are asked for an email for verification purpose. We verify by email
              because we don't want ill intended people or bots to spam and diminish the integrity of our pleas.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the forms you will find an option to receive updates regarding the plea. If you check this box, we will use
              the email for that purpose. Other than that, your email isn't shared with anybody else. We keep the email in
              our databases only to prevent users from supporting the same plea with the same email address multiple times.
            </p>

            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>
              In the forms we also ask for your country. The purpose of gathering these locations is so the companies know
              where demand is concentrated. In an ideal world they would do so for a worldwide market. However, they may not
              always have the resources for this. We want all businesses, large or small, to launch vegan products
              successfully, so they will happily and naturally invest more efforts into similar products.

          <clr-accordion-title>When and how are businesses notified?</clr-accordion-title>
          <clr-accordion-content *clrIfExpanded>
            <p>
              Currently each plea has 3 supporter targets: {{ PLEA_TARGET.FIRST }}, {{ PLEA_TARGET.SECOND }} and
              {{ PLEA_TARGET.THIRD }}. We may adjust these targets over time. Whenever a target is hit, we will send out an
              email to the company in question with the plea included.

            <p>We have a couple of pages where we focus on successfully achieved results and plea-compliant companies:</p>

              <!--          TODO: also add appreciation msg feed (send some love thingy)-->
              We like to put a spotlight on the success stories in order to promote the products and show our appreciation.
              This way it will be easier for you in turn to support these businesses and their products.
            </p>

            <h3>Stay updated</h3>
            <p>
              If you check the box to receive updates when initiating or supporting a plea, you will also receive
              notifications by mail when a target has been reached or when a business has launched the product.
